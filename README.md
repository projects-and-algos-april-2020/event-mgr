# event-mgr
This is the MVP of the Event Manager application designed to store data related to the process of selecting and applying to a college or university. The MVP will allow a user to: create an account, login to the application using the account, view a summary of account information and events they have registered for. The user can view a list of events and register for one event at a time. If the user chooses not to attend the event they can cancel the registration. The user can update account information including fields not available during registration. Those fields include integration with Facebook and Twitter, a personal photo, and location based data.
