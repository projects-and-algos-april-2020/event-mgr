# event-mgr
Event Manager was designed to store data related to the process of selecting and applying to a college or university. Event Manager will allow a user to: create an account, login to the application using the account, view a summary of account information and events they have registered for. The user can view a list of events and register for one event at a time. If the user chooses not to attend the event they can cancel the registration via the summary. The user can update account information including fields not available during registration. The extra account summary fields include adding a personal photo.

Future functionality: The user account will include integration with Facebook to post an update on a specific event, and an event location map via Google maps.
